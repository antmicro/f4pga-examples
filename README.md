# SymbiFlow examples

This repository provides example FPGA designs that can be built using the SymbiFlow open source toolchain.
The examples target the Xilinx Artix-7 and the QuickLogic EOS S3 devices.

The repository includes:

* [examples](./examples) - Example FPGA designs including:

  * Verilog code
  * Pin constraints files
  * Timing constraints files
  * Makefiles for running the SymbiFlow toolchain

* [.travis.yml](.travis.yml) - Travis CI configuration file

Please refer to the documentation in `docs` for a proper guide on how to run these examples.
